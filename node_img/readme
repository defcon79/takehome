This is a sample node app prototype which I used for testing various things.

It runs an express server which exposes an endpoint that -

- accepts a list of urls which are meant to be images
- downloads them
- computes an image color for each image (see comment in imgColor.js for why this is mocked)

In addition a number of extra things are done such as -

- enhanced logging
- making this performant under load by using external utils such as wget for async tasks
- using async/await 
- multiple caller handling by isolating each request in its own sandbox
- files are downloaded and cleaned up in temp folder (wkdir) which can be cached for later use

Instructions -

Needs Node v8 or later
install dependencies with 'npm i'
start node server with 'npm start'
open the test page - caller.html and press the button
view logs in console and in /logs dir

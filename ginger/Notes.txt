Notes

This is a basic search prototype for Giphy. A few special things -

- there's an option to 'search as you type'
- search activates only when you type a min no of chars 
- both of these were prob overkill but its a nicer user experience and I wanted to do it!
- all the config values are parametrized and easily seen in the code
- The data loader and cache is fairly agnostic. All Giphy specific functions are factored out
- it can be easily transformed to use any other set of data
- cache stores transformed data only as thats much smaller
- the cache is LRU
- the UI shows cache stats as well
- the layout is responsive
- uses async/await for easier readability and other ES6 features as needed

Things that can be improved/added

- Redux
- UI polish :)
- cache persistence
